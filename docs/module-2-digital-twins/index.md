# Module 2: Digital Twins

Welcome to the Digital Twins module! This module covers:

1. **Physics Simulation with Gazebo** - Learn how to create realistic physics-based simulations
2. **Digital Twin and HRI in Unity** - Create interactive digital twins with human-robot interaction
3. **Sensor Simulation and Validation** - Simulate sensors and validate their accuracy

## Prerequisites

- ROS 2 fundamentals
- Python basics

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Set up physics-based simulations using Gazebo
- Create digital twins in Unity with realistic HRI
- Simulate various robot sensors and validate their outputs
