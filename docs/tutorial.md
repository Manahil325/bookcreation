# Digital Twins Tutorial

Welcome to the comprehensive Digital Twins tutorial! This tutorial covers the complete workflow for creating and working with digital twins in robotics applications.

## Overview

This tutorial is organized into three main modules:

1. **Physics Simulation with Gazebo** - Learn to create realistic physics-based simulations
2. **Digital Twin and HRI in Unity** - Create interactive digital twins with human-robot interaction
3. **Sensor Simulation and Validation** - Simulate sensors and validate their accuracy

Each module builds upon the previous one, providing a complete understanding of digital twin development for robotics.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this tutorial, you should have:

- Basic knowledge of ROS 2
- Python programming fundamentals
- Understanding of basic physics concepts
- Familiarity with simulation environments

## Module 1: Physics Simulation with Gazebo

### Learning Objectives

## Module 2: Digital Twin and HRI in Unity

### Learning Objectives
- Set up Unity for robotics simulation
- Create digital twin models
- Implement HRI patterns
- Validate digital twin behavior

### Topics Covered
1. [Unity Setup](./module-2-digital-twins/chapter-2-unity-hri/unity-setup.md)
2. [Digital Twin Creation](./module-2-digital-twins/chapter-2-unity-hri/digital-twin-creation.md)
3. [HRI Concepts](./module-2-digital-twins/chapter-2-unity-hri/hri-concepts.md)
4. [Chapter 2 Exercises](./module-2-digital-twins/chapter-2-unity-hri/exercises.md)

### Getting Started
Before starting this module, ensure you have Unity installed and configured. Begin with [Unity Setup](./module-2-digital-twins/chapter-2-unity-hri/unity-setup.md) to prepare your development environment.

## Module 3: Sensor Simulation and Validation

### Learning Objectives
- Simulate different sensor types

4. [Chapter 3 Exercises](./module-2-digital-twins/chapter-3-sensor-validation/exercises.md)

### Getting Started
This module assumes familiarity with both Gazebo and Unity. Start with [Sensor Types](./module-2-digital-twins/chapter-3-sensor-validation/sensor-types.md) to understand different sensor modalities.

## Integration and Best Practices

### Connecting the Modules
The three modules are designed to work together as a complete digital twin system:

1. Physics simulation provides the foundation for realistic behavior
2. Digital twin creation enables visualization and interaction
3. Sensor simulation allows for perception and validation

### Best Practices
- Start with simple scenarios and gradually increase complexity
- Validate each component individually before integration
- Document your findings and configurations
- Test with various environmental conditions

## Assessment and Validation

Each chapter includes exercises to validate your understanding:

- Complete the exercises at the end of each chapter
- Compare your results with expected outcomes
- Document any challenges and solutions
- Review the concepts you found most challenging

## Next Steps

After completing this tutorial, you should be able to:

1. Create realistic physics simulations using Gazebo
2. Build digital twins in Unity with HRI capabilities
3. Simulate and validate various sensor types
4. Integrate all components into a complete digital twin system
